How to use this thing
---------------------

For starters, you need emacs. (I use emacs 23 in Ubuntu and Aquamacs in OS X.)

You'll need to put this in your ~/emacs.d directory. (In theory, you can use
any directory you like if you set `local-elisp-directory', but this isn't very
well tested.) Then you need the following line in your .emacs::

    (load-file "~/.emacs.d/setup-prefs.el")

Everything else should happen automagically. See the various elisp files for
details.
